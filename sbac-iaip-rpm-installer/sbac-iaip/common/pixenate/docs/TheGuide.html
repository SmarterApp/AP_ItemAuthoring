<h1>The Guide : A manual for customizing PXN8 to suit your website identity.</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>	
	PXN8 is a customizable web-based photo editor. 

	While you are more than welcome to use any of the supplied themes as-is
	they are provided as starting points for your own customizations.
</p>
<p>
	This guide covers two types of customizations...
	
	<ol>
	<li><h3>Basic: Appearance customizations</h3>
<p>
	Appearance customizations include the following...
</p>
   <ul>
	<li>Replacing the PXN8 logo with your own organization's logo.</li>
	<li>Changing the structure of the page (changes to the HTML).</li>
	<li>Changing the appearance of the page (changes to HTML & CSS)</li>
   </ul>
</li>

<li><h3>Advanced: Behaviour customizations</h3>

<p>
	Behaviour customizations include the following...
</p>
   <ul>
	<li>Changing the user interaction by implementing your own PXN8
	javascript callbacks.</li>
	
	<li>Modifying the tool configuration UI (changes to
	pxn8_tools_ui.js)</li>

	<li>Writing your own tool UI (calling the PXN8.tool.* functions
	directly from your own code).</li>
   </ul>
</li>
</ol>

	The PXN8 editor page can be written using JSP, PHP or any
	web templating language. 
	
	Here is a description of each of the supplied sample
	customizations...
	<ol>
	<li><b>slick</b> - This is the theme currently used on the pxn8.com website. While
	by no means using all of the features of PXN8, it should be a good
	place to start getting ideas about your own themed editor.</li>
	
	<li><b>default</b> - This was the default theme used on pxn8.com for a
	long time until superceded by slick. In appearance, both 'slick'
	and 'default' look very similar, but they differ in two aspects..
	<ol>
	<li>tool configuration behaviour.</li>
	<li>layout and positioning of the canvas.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
	The 'default' theme is 'modeless' in that users can click any of the
	tool buttons while an existing tool configuration dialog is
	visible. The 'slick' theme doesn't allow this. You cannot click a
	tool button until the current tool is 'applied' or 'cancelled' -
	the 'slick' theme is 'modal'.
	</p>
	<p>
	Also, the positioning of the canvas in the 'slick' theme differs to
	the 'default' theme. In the 'slick' theme, other page elements (the
	google adsense area) appear beneath the canvas. This is simply to
	demonstrate that the canvas can be positioned either relatively or
	absolutely within any element on the page. 
	</p></li>

	
	<li><b>Memphis</b> - This theme illustrates a number of PXN8 concepts not
	addressed by the 'slick' and 'default' themes. 
	<ol>
	<li>Scrolling - The canvas appears within a scrollable panel.</li>
	<li>Enabling and disabling of buttons based on user interactions.
	      'memphis' makes use of the PXN8.onImageUpdated,
	      PXN8.onSelectArea and PXN8.onSelectNone callback functions to
	be notified when certain events internal to PXN8 have taken place.</li>
	
	<li>Calling PXN8.tools.* functions directly. 'Memphis' doesn't
	make much use of the standard tool config UI from the
	pxn8_tools_ui.js module. Instead, most image operations are invoked
	from a single button click.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
	If you want to dive right into customizing the default editor
	behaviour, then close study of the 'memphis' theme is as good a
	place as any to start.
	</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<h2>Skill Prerequisites.</h2>

	In order to customize PXN8 to suit your own website, you must be
	comfortable working with (at a bare minimum) HTML and CSS.
	
	If you would rather have editor customizations completed by Sxoop
	Technologies then send an email to customizations@sxoop.com with a
	screenshot or mockup of the desired layout and
	behaviour. Alternatively call +353 86-8511600 or skype walterh.rm
	to discuss requirements in detail.


<h1>Part 1: Basic Customization (Appearance).</h1>

	Let's start by looking at the simplest possible editor you could
	write using PXN8. 

** required elements

*** The canvas
<div class="sidebar" style="float: left; ">
<h3>A note on Safari</h3>Safari's Javascript does not support computed
style sheets - that is - the style for an element cannot be read
unless the style is declared inline.
</div>
PXN8 requires that the 'pxn8_canvas' element must be positioned
either relatively or absolutely using the CSS position property (the
default position property for DIVs is 'static' - this causes problems
for PXN8 in that it cannot correctly determine the canvas bounds.
PXN8 will position the canvas relatively if a position property is not
present in either the inline or computed style. 
However because Safari's javascript implementation cannot see computed
stylesheet properties - only those properties which are declared
inline, it is recommended doing one of two things...
<ol>
<li>Enclose the canvas in a relatively or absolutely positioned element
or...</li>
<li>Specify the 'position' property inline for the canvas</li>
</ol>

**** Positioning the canvas
**** Some assumptions 
**** Scrolling the canvas

**** Canvas Selection
**** Styling the selection area (and surroundings)

** optional elements



** The organization of PXN8 Javascript

*** Required javascript
**** pxn8_core.js
***** PXN8 Callback functions

**** pxn8_tools.js
**** pxn8_strings.js

*** Optional javascript
**** pxn8_tools_ui.js
**** colors.js
**** tooltips.js
**** slider.js
</div>
</body>
</html>
