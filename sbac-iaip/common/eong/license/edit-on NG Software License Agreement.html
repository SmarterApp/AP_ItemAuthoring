        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>READ CAREFULLY BEFORE COPYING, INSTALLING OR USING THIS SOFTWARE.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Article 1 - GENERAL</h3>
        <p>This Software License Agreement (hereinafter "this Agreement") is a legal agreement between you, the customer
            or licensee (either an individual or a legal entity that directly or indirectly acquires this Software for
            installation on its application/system) and RealObjects GmbH. The copyright of this software (hereinafter
            "the Software" or "edit-on&#xae; NG") and its associated documentation (including any files, source code,
            images, photographs, animations and text incorporated into the Software, but excluding any third-party
            software and/or open source software) as well as any accompanying written materials is owned by RealObjects
            GmbH ("the Owner" or "RealObjects") whose registered office is at Altenkesseler Str. 17/B6, 66115
            Saarbruecken, Germany, and is protected by German copyright laws and regulations and, as far as these are
            implemented into German law, by international treaties.</p>
        <p>By downloading, installing, copying or otherwise using the Software, you agree with the Owner to be bound by
            the terms and conditions of this Agreement, which will govern your use of the Software. If you do not agree
            to this Agreement, do not download, install or use the Software. Any offence against this Agreement will be
            prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. You will be held responsible for any employees or users who
            receive the Software and in turn make unauthorized copies.</p>
        <p>You may copy the Software to another disk or media, for the purpose of backup protection only in the event of
            a system wide crash. Installation of the Software onto a system that you use means that you have accepted
            and agreed to the terms that govern the use of copyrighted software.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Article 2 - GRANT OF LICENSE</h3>
        <p>RealObjects grants to you and you accept, subject to the terms and conditions set out in this Agreement, a
            nonexclusive, nontransferable, nonsublicensable, and revocable right to use the Software solely and strictly
            in accordance with the following conditions and restrictions. You hold full responsibility for assuring that
            all users of the Software provided access under the provisions of the Software license adhere to all
            provisions and prohibitions of this Agreement.</p>
        <p>CPU License. Use the Software and the Documentation in an Intranet/Extranet, or over Internet installation
            with non-anonymous or anonymous users. The use is limited to the number of CPU licenses bought with/for the
            Software. One CPU license is required for each CPU of the server(s) running your application/system which
            embeds edit-on NG. It does not matter how edit-on NG is technically separated from your application/system.
            Regardless of where or how edit-on NG is loaded, all CPUs that serve the application/system which embeds
            edit-on NG have to be licensed. The CPU License is valid for 1 (one) CPU, and licenses for additional CPUs
            can be bought in license packs with 1 (one) CPU license each. A CPU license includes access for an unlimited
            number of users to connect from either inside the corporate local area network (LAN), wide area network
            (WAN), or outside the firewall.</p>
        <p>Processor. One CPU license is required for each CPU of the server(s) running your application/system which
            embeds edit-on NG.</p>
        <p>Active/Passive. The only permissible exception to the above requirements for a CPU license is a purely
            passive server in an active/passive fail-over cluster. If the Software is used in a clustered environment,
            the licensee may use the Software on a temporary basis on a server that is employed only for fail-over
            support (the "passive server") so long as the number of CPUs on the passive server does not exceed the
            number of CPUs on the licensee&#x2019;s primary active server. In this configuration, the passive server
            does not require a CPU license. Active/active configurations require licensing both servers as usual.</p>
        <p>Multiplexing using Middleware and Multi-Tiered Architecture. Multiplexing is the use of hardware and/or
            software to reduce the number of devices that directly access or use the Software on a particular server. An
            example of multiplexing is a server application that calls a process on one server, which in turn pulls data
            from the Software on another server. The client computer has a direct connection to the server running the
            process, but it also has an indirect connection to the other server because it is ultimately retrieving and
            using the Software data through the server running the process. Use of such multiplexing, pooling, or
            related hardware and/or software does not reduce the number of CPU licenses required for the Software.
            Regardless of how many tiers of hardware or software exist between the server(s) and the client devices that
            ultimately use its data, services, or functionality, a CPU license is required for each distinct input to
            the multiplexing, pooling, or related software or the hardware front end.</p>
        <p>You are not permitted to:</p>
        <p>(a) make copies of, or distribute any parts of the Software, except for backup, archival and disaster
            recovery purposes.</p>
        <p>(b) rent, lease, sub-license, loan, copy, modify, alter, adapt, merge, translate, reverse engineer,
            decompile, or re-package the Software into another product, or to disassemble it or create derivative works,
            based on the whole, or any part, of the Software or its associated documentation. Reverse engineering and
            modification however is permitted for those parts of the Software that are based on third-party software
            and/or open source software which is licensed under a different license, but only if required by that
            license or in case of statutory provisions.</p>
        <p>(c) copy the Software for the purpose of illegal distribution.</p>
        <p>RealObjects will provide you an unlock key, which enables you to use of the Software license. The information
            contained in the unlock key will include among others the type of license and the number of licensed CPUs.
            You might also have to provide the name(s) of the machine(s) on which the Software will be installed.
            RealObjects further reserves the right to introduce and use appropriate license enforcement techniques in
            its software, which are designed to prevent illegal use or distribution of the Software. The license
            enforcement techniques might require activation of the Software license. This may require establishing a
            temporary network connection to a RealObjects web service. RealObjects reserves all rights to modify the
            license enforcement techniques used in the Software at any time.</p>
        <p>If you possess an evaluation or demonstration license of the Software, you may download, install and use the
            Software on your machine for evaluation or demonstration purposes only. You are not allowed to use the
            evaluation or demonstration license for commercial or production purposes. The evaluation and demonstration
            licenses might be time limited and may include other restrictions in terms of functionality.</p>
        <p>Application Service Provider (ASP). An ASP is a service firm which deploys, manages, and delivers application
            capabilities to multiple entities from a data center, across a wide area network, and/or through
            centrally-located machine(s) or server(s) under a "rental" or lease agreement, free of charge or at cost.
            Except for the limitation described below, the CPU License of the Software can be utilized as part of an ASP
            service offering whereby you provide web-based software and hosting of that software for use by third
            parties for a fee or free of charge.</p>
        <p>Limitation of ASP utilization. You are not permitted to use the CPU License of the Software as part of your
            ASP service in order to offer XML/XHTML/HTML editing functionality, which substantially duplicates the
            functionality of the Software. edit-on&#xae; NG functionality as part of any kind of ASP offering is only
            permitted as long as the edit-on&#xae; NG functionality remains an inferior functionality as part of a
            superior ASP feature set and/or service.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Article 3 - FEES</h3>
        <p>All of your rights und the Software license are contingent upon your payment of all applicable license fees.
            If such fees have not been paid prior to your acceptance of the Software license, you agree to pay such fees
            promptly thereafter and before using the Software</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Article 4 - SUPPORT AND MAINTENANCE</h3>

        <p>Whether or not you have purchased the 1Year Support &amp; Maintenance subscription, technical support only
            covers issues or questions resulting directly out of the operation of the Software and RealObjects will not
            provide you with generic consultation, assistance, or advice under any circumstances.</p>
        <p>Updating the Software may require the updating of software not covered by this Agreement before installation.
            Updates of the operating system and application software not specifically covered by this Agreement are your
            responsibility and will not be provided by RealObjects under this Agreement.</p>
        <p>RealObjects' obligations under this Article 4 are contingent upon your proper use of the Software and your
            compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement at all times. RealObjects shall be under no
            obligation to provide the above technical support if, in RealObjects' opinion, the Software has failed due
            to the following conditions: (i) damage caused by the relocation of the Software to another location or CPU;
            (ii) alterations, modifications or attempts to change the Software without RealObjects&#x2019; written
            approval; (iii) causes external to the Software, such as natural disasters, the failure or fluctuation of
