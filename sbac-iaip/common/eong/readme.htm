        <h3>Installation</h3>
        <p>Copy the edit-on NG folder (complete with all sub folders) to your web server.</p>
        <p>Note: If IIS is used as web server it might be neccessary to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Rename the "bin" folder, as by default all "bin" folders are configured as "hiddensegment" in IIS,
                though requests to these folders will be blocked. Please make also sure to change the base url in
                setBaseURL() accordingly.</li>
            <li>Register json files as mimetype in IIS</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Release Notes and Known Issues</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Make sure to read the documentation, which can be found in the /documentation directory.</li>
            <li>The API of edit-on NG is not directly compatible with existing integrations of edit-on Pro 5 or
                earlier.</li>
            <li>When running edit-on NG using Safari for Windows, a "java.net.MalformedURLException: no protocol:"
                exception is displayed in the Java Console when the applet has loaded or whenever a LiveConnect call is
                performed. This does not have any effect on the functionality of edit-on NG and is an issue that is not
                caused by the editor itself and can be replicated with Safari for Windows in combination with any other
                Java applet.</li>
        </ul>

            <li>It is now easier to see that editing in the in-place editing mode is disabled when a dialog is

                possible to use this with edit-on NG 2.0, however you cannot mix new and deprecated uiconfig patterns in
                one pane.</li>
            <li>Deprecated method: "loadInplaceToolbarIcons". Use "loadCustomJavaIcons" instead. The new method is used

        </ul>
        <p><strong>1.5.1823: First Release of edit-on NG 1.5</strong></p>
        <p>The new features include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Added API method to programmatically resize the editor.</li>
            <li>Attributes can now be removed using the setElementAttributes, setParentElementByNameAttributes,
                setBlockElementAttributes, setCurrentTableRowCellAttributes and setCurrentTableColumnCellAttributes
                methods.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>General Improvements:</p>
        <ul>

            <li>The editor now falls back to a default document when trying to load an empty document.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Performance Improvements:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Improved the reaction time when pressing action buttons across all browsers and specs. This should be
                especially noticeable on lower end systems, but should generally feel more responsive on all
                systems.</li>
            <li>Optimized dialog performance. Dialogs should now generally be displayed faster when they are
                opened.</li>
            <li>Optimized the color picker. The color picker is now more responsive and handles more smoothly on lower
                end systems, or using Internet Explorer.</li>
            <li>Toolbar drop downs are now displayed faster.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Changes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The order of the arguments taken by the "insertImage" API method has changed. The arguments for this
                method now are "string src, string alt, string width, string height, string border" instead of "string
                src, string width, string height, string border, string alt". All arguments except "src" and "alt" now
                are optional and may be ignored or set to "null".</li>
            <li>The "insert-image" action now assumes "px" as unit for image width, height, or border width if no other
                unit is specified.</li>
            <li>The handling of base URLs was improved. In edit-on NG 1.0.1740, the handling of base URLs did not match
                the behavior described in the manual. The behavior was improved in general and its description was
                updated to match the changes. For methods that may accept a document base URL:
                <ol>
                    <li>If no document base URL is specified, use the URL of the document as base for resources.</li>
                    <li>If a document base URL is specified, use it instead.</li>
                    <li>If the document base URL is explicitly set to null, use the default base URL.</li>
                    <li>If the document base URL is disabled and no default base URL is specified, fall back to the code
                        base.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Deprecated the "setExtensionDirectoryURL" API method. Use
                <ul>
                    <li>setActionExtensionURL(string URL)</li>
                    <li>setDialogExtensionURL(string URL)</li>
                    <li>addLocaleExtensionURL(string localeCode, string localeURL)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left: 30pt">instead.</p>
        <p>Bug fixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tooltips displayed in the context menu are now localized.</li>
            <li>Fixed NPE when inserting a hyperlink while multiple block elements are selected.</li>
            <li>Fixed a JavaScript error in Internet Explorer when "saveuistate" is set to false in the configuration
                file.</li>
            <li>Auto correction entries are now properly removed.</li>
            <li>The "Insert Table" dialog is now correctly displayed in Internet Explorer 7.</li>
            <li>Special characters are now properly encoded in annotations.</li>
            <li>Auto-hyperlinking at the start of a sentence is now possible.</li>
            <li>Fixed issue where the in-place toolbar was not hidden when clicking in the editor using Mac OS X with
                JRE 1.6.0u20.</li>
            <li>The "elementNames" filter in the actions configuration now no longer ignores element names other than
                the first.</li>
            <li>It is now possible to move the focus away from the editor in Safari 4.0.5 on Mac OS X.</li>
            <li>Using the shortcuts CTRL+1 through CTRL+6 in order to change the current paragraph to heading 1 through
                6 no longer also inserts a character with the corresponding number on Mac OS X.</li>
            <li>The directory containing the edit-on NG files now can contain the string "edit-on-ng".</li>
            <li>The "insert-pagebreak" action now inserts a "div" element with appropriate inline styles instead of a
                "div" element with the class "pageBreak".</li>
            <li>Fixed exception when calling getCurrentTableColumnCellAttributes or
                getCurrentTableRowCellAttributes.</li>
            <li>The methods setCurrentTableColumnCellAttributes and setCurrentTableRowCellAttributes now accept the
                object returned by their getter counterparts (getCurrentTableColumnCellAttributes and
                getCurrentTableRowCellAttributes resp.) as argument.</li>
            <li>Unless otherwise stored in the user preferences, the first tab panel is now always displayed instead of
                the second when the editor is loaded.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Additional Notes:</p>
        <p>Selecting a single word via double-click or an entire block through a triple-click was previously not
            possible on Mac OS X machines due to missing events in that environment. This has been remedied by Apple in
            Mac OS 10.6 Update 3 and 10.5 Update 8.</p>
