        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>READ CAREFULLY BEFORE COPYING, INSTALLING OR USING THIS SOFTWARE.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Article 1 - GENERAL</h3>
        <p>This Software License Agreement (hereinafter "this Agreement") is a legal agreement between you, the customer
            or licensee (either an individual or a legal entity that directly or indirectly acquires this Software for
            installation on its application or system) and RealObjects GmbH. The copyright of this software (hereinafter
            "the Software" or "edit-on&reg; NG") including the optional VersioTrack&reg; Add-on software (hereinafter
            "VersioTrack&reg;") and its associated documentation (including any files, source code, images, photographs,
            animations and text incorporated into the Software, but excluding any third-party software and open source
            software) as well as any accompanying written materials is owned by RealObjects GmbH ("the Owner" or
            "RealObjects") whose registered office is at Altenkesseler Str. 17/B6, 66115 Saarbruecken, Germany, and is
            protected by German copyright laws and regulations and, as far as these are implemented into German law, by
            international treaties.</p>
        <p>By downloading, installing, copying or otherwise using the Software including VersioTrack&reg;, you agree
            with the Owner to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement, which will govern your use of the
            Software. If you do not agree to this Agreement, do not download, install or use the Software. Any offence
            against this Agreement will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. You will be held responsible for
            any employees or users who receive the Software and in turn make unauthorized copies.</p>
        <p>You may copy the Software to another disk or media, for the purpose of backup protection only in the event of
            a system wide crash. Installation of the Software onto a system that you use means that you have accepted
            and agreed to the terms that govern the use of copyrighted software.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Article 2 - GRANT OF LICENSE</h3>
        <p>RealObjects grants to you and you accept, subject to the terms and conditions set out in this Agreement, a
            nonexclusive, nontransferable, nonsublicensable, and revocable right to use the Software solely and strictly
            in accordance with the following conditions and restrictions. You hold full responsibility for assuring that
            all users of the Software provided access under the provisions of the Software license adhere to all
            provisions and prohibitions of this Agreement.</p>
        <p>CPU License. Use the Software on 1 (one) physical or virtual machine in an Intranet or Extranet, or over
            Internet installation with non-anonymous or anonymous users. This Software may be used only on the licensed
            physical or virtual machine containing 1 (one) CPU.&nbsp; Licenses for additional CPUs can be bought from
            RealObjects. It does not matter how edit-on NG is technically separated from your application or system.</p>
        <p>Active/Passive. The only permissible exception to the above requirements for a CPU license is a purely
            passive machine or server in an active/passive fail-over cluster. If the Software is used in a clustered
            environment, the licensee may use the Software on a temporary basis on a machine or server that is employed
            only for fail-over support (the "passive machine or server") so long as the number of CPUs on the passive
            machine or server does not exceed the number of CPUs on the licensee&rsquo;s primary active machine or
            server. In this configuration, the passive machine or server does not require a separate CPU license.
            Active/active configurations require licensing of both machines or servers as usual.</p>
        <p>You are not permitted to:</p>
        <p>(a) make copies of, or distribute any parts of the Software, except for backup, archival and disaster
            recovery purposes.</p>
        <p>(b) rent, lease, sub-license, loan, copy, modify, alter, adapt, merge, translate, reverse engineer,
            decompile, or re-package the Software into another product, or to disassemble it or create derivative works,
            based on the whole, or any part, of the Software or its associated documentation. Reverse engineering and
            modification however is permitted for those parts of the Software that are based on third-party software or
            open source software which is licensed under a different license, but only if required by that license or in
            case of statutory provisions.</p>
        <p>(c) copy the Software for the purpose of illegal distribution.</p>
        <p>RealObjects will provide you an unlock key, which enables you to use of the Software license. The information
            contained in the unlock key will include among others the type of license and the number of licensed CPUs.
            You might also have to provide the name(s) of the machine(s) on which the Software will be installed.
            RealObjects further reserves the right to introduce and use appropriate license enforcement techniques in
            its software, which are designed to prevent illegal use or distribution of the Software. The license
            enforcement techniques might require activation of the Software license. This may require establishing a
            temporary network connection to a RealObjects web service. RealObjects reserves all rights to modify the
            license enforcement techniques used in the Software at any time.</p>
        <p>If you have an evaluation or demonstration license of the Software, you may download, install and use the
            Software on your machine for evaluation or demonstration purposes only. You are not allowed to use the
            evaluation or demonstration license for commercial or production purposes. The evaluation and demonstration
            licenses might be time limited and may include other restrictions in terms of functionality.</p>
        <p>Application Service Provider (ASP). An ASP is a service firm which deploys, manages, and delivers application
            capabilities to multiple entities from a data center, across a wide area network, or through
            centrally-located machine(s) or server(s) under a "rental" or lease agreement, free of charge or at cost.
            Except for the limitation described below, the CPU License of the Software can be utilized as part of an ASP
            service offering whereby you provide web-based software and hosting of that software for use by third
            parties for a fee or free of charge.</p>
        <p>Software as a Service (SaaS). SaaS is a software delivery model in which software and associated data are
            centrally hosted in the cloud. SaaS is typically accessed by users using a thin client via a web browser.
            Except for the limitation described below, the CPU License of the Software can be utilized as part of a SaaS
            service offering whereby you provide web-based software and hosting of that software for use by third
            parties for a fee or free of charge.</p>
        <p>Limitation of ASP and SaaS utilization. You are not permitted to use the CPU License of the Software as part
            of your ASP or SaaS offeringin order to provide XML/XHTML/HTML editing functionality, which substantially
            duplicates the functionality of the Software. edit-on&reg; NG functionality as part of any kind of ASP or
            SaaS offering is only permitted as long as the edit-on&reg; NG functionality remains an inferior
            functionality as part of a superior ASP or SaaS feature set or service.</p>

            RealObjects will not provide you with generic consultation, assistance, or advice under any
            circumstances.</p>
        <p>Updating the Software may require the updating of software not covered by this Agreement before installation.
            Updates of the operating system and application software not specifically covered by this Agreement are your
            responsibility and will not be provided by RealObjects under this Agreement.</p>
        <p>RealObjects' obligations under this Article 3 are contingent upon your proper use of the Software and your
            compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement at all times. RealObjects shall be under no
            obligation to provide the above technical support if, in RealObjects' opinion, the Software has failed due
            to the following conditions: (i) damage caused by the relocation of the Software to another location or CPU;
            (ii) alterations, modifications or attempts to change the Software without RealObjects&rsquo; written
            approval; (iii) causes external to the Software, such as natural disasters, the failure or fluctuation of
