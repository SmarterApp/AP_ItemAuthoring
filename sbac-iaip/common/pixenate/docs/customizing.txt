==============================================================

PXN8 is based on standard web technologies, Perl, HTML, CSS and
Javascript.
As such, customizing the appearance of PXN8 can be done by modifying
HTML (or JSP/ASP/PHP) and CSS stylesheets. The client-side behaviour can
be modified by changing the javascript. 
The server-side behaviour can be extended by adding new CGI scripts
and or writing and registering new image-manipulation routines in
perl.


The following document describes how to customize PXN8 to suit your
own company or organization's needs.

** Changing the appearance of PXN8

In order to change the appearance of PXN8 you will need to have some
knowledge of HTML and CSS. HTML is short for Hypertext Markup
Language. It is a declarative language for specifying the structure of
web pages. CSS is short for Cascading Style Sheets, it too is a
declarative language for specifying the layout and appearance of
individual elements within a web page. 

PXN8 ships with 2 ready-made themes

1. default 
2. slick

JSP and PHP versions of each are available (default.jsp, default.php,
slick.jsp, slick.php). Pick one of these supplied themes and copy it
to a new file mycompany.php or mycompany.jsp.

You are now ready to begin customizing PXN8. Probably the first thing
you will want to do with PXN8 is change the logo which appears in the
top right corner of the web page, to match your organization's
logo. 
First copy the company logo image into the images directory. Then open
the mycompany.jsp/php  in your
favourite editor and change the logo.

This only scratches the surface of customizing. Each of the 2 themes
uses their own stylesheet. As with the php/jsp, it is recommended that
you copy one of the stylesheets to a new file name mycompany.css.

Each of the stylesheets has entries for elements with names beginning
'pxn8_'. Changing the style of such elements is not recommended unless
you have working knowledge of CSS. All other element styles can be
changed.

Similarly each of the pages (php,jsp) contain elements with ids
beginning 'pxn8_'. It is recommended that you include each of these
elements in any new customized editor page you created.

In particular, while you can change the placement of the 'pxn8_canvas'
element, it is not recommended that you remove any of the elements
contained within it.

This is just the simplest, most trivial example of how PXN8's User
interface appearance can be customized to suit your needs.
